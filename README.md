# Prediction for Likelihood of Loan or Credit card approval


OBJECTIVE:
This project will estimate a predictive model to predict whether a consumer is approved for a credit card, using the dataset that corresponds to the last digit of your student number. This might be useful to a firm that is selecting which consumers to target, choosing how much to pay for the contact information of a consumer, or a firm that is simply trying to forecast demand. Firms with better predictive models will be able to more efficiently target consumers, or make better purchasing decisions.
